                    James and his coworkers at the JFK8 Amazon fulfillment center on Staten Island typically have just eight minutes to use 
                    the bathroom until questions and comments from upper management begin.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span>“I feel like I'm under a microscope every day,”</span> said James, who did not want his last name used for fear of retaliation from 
                    Amazon. “My rate is tracked. If I walk off the belt for too long and I come back, there's someone there waiting for me.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    James is one of the more than 5,000 members of the Amazon Labor Union-International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 1 at JFK8 who has been 
                    waiting 1,000 days for a contract. So far, Amazon has not come to the table to negotiate with them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “The way they treat people is, <span>you're just a number. They don't care</span>,” said James. “They don't.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a result, the workers at JFK8, alongside workers all across the country at nine different facilities, who are all either affiliated with 
                    or represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, held a days-long strike during one of the busiest times of the year for Amazon. 
                    The strike ended on Christmas Eve, 2024.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Amazon, which is valued at $2 trillion, did not sit down to negotiate a new contract with its unionized workforces at any point during the work stoppage.

                <p>
                    Despite having ample time to recognize and sit down with the ALU, the company filed 25 objections with the National Labor Relations Board, contending the 
                    union election in 2022 wasn’t free and fair, among other things.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Amazon even successfully petitioned the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in September to temporarily block the National Labor Relations Board from deciding 
                    on whether the company must bargain with their newly unionized workforce.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “They argue that, ‘Well hey, it might not matter that they exist to us unless we are court ordered to talk to them’,” said Cameron Black, an assistant professor 
                    of labor studies at the City University of New York School of Labor and Urban Studies. The company believes it “might be able to exhaust the funds and willpower 
                    of the union.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    After years of waiting on Amazon to negotiate in good faith, the ALU decided to hit their employer where it hurt: their bottom line. The strike came at a critical 
                    time in key locations for the company as December is one of the most profitable months for the corporation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Over the years, Amazon has illegally gone after employees who have openly supported the ALU and organized their colleagues to join the union. The ALU has specifically 
                    called for $30 hourly minimum wages for the JFK8 fulfillment center workers they represent, which would amount to <span>$62,400 annually before taxes</span>. The union has also 
                    demanded better working conditions and more job security.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The current CEO of Amazon, Andrew Jassy, made <span>$29.2 million</span> in compensation in 2023. Amazon’s net profit in 2023 was <span>$30.4 billion</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of the ALU’s demands involves nixing Amazon’s current three strike policy. If a worker commits either the same behavioral or productivity violation three times in 
                    a row within a specific time period, they are fired. Behavioral infractions involve using your phone at a workstation, and productivity infractions involve actions such 
                    as taking too long in the bathroom.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “They are one mistake away from getting kicked out of their apartment, and Amazon doesn't see that,” said James. “Amazon just sees, well, you're using your phone; you're 
                    hurting our bottom line.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite the nationwide strikes, Amazon dismisses the organizers and claims their bottom line is intact. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    “What you’re seeing at these sites are almost entirely outsiders—not Amazon employees or partners,” said Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel. “We appreciate all our team’s 
                    great work to serve their customers and communities, and thanks to them, we’re not seeing any impact to customers’ orders.”
